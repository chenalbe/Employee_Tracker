# Employee_Tracker

As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business

This tool is constructed with the combination of Node and SQL.
For the SQL part, there are total of 3 tables in the same database:
1. Department.
2. Role.
3. Employee. 

There are 3 main functions for this app:

1. Add departments, roles, employees.
2. View departments, roles, employees.
3. Update employee roles.

By using data from different table, this app provides the user with choices based on the data from the table in stead providing input for every entry.
